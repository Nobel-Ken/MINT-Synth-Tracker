# [Software] MINT Synth Sequencer
MINT is a WIP sequencer for making music on DIY hardware sound synths, such as the Wave16 I have built. It sends notes over a USB serial connection to the selected synth or can (very rudimentary) send MIDI notes out via a virtual MIDI port. It is not yet intended for general use.
